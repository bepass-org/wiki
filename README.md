### P2P Tic-tac-toe

#### What Is It?

This project is all about building a peer-to-peer (P2P) Tic-Tac-Toe game.

#### Why?

Well, it's because we want you to grasp how TCP works under the hood. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) makes sure data gets from one place to another reliably. By creating this P2P Tic-Tac-Toe, you'll get hands-on experience with TCP and learn how to handle data streams, which can be a bit tricky but super rewarding once you get the hang of it.

#### What Will You Learn?

In this project, you won't just be playing Tic-Tac-Toe; you'll also be learning how to **synchronize** data transfer over the network. This is a crucial skill, whether you're building games, apps, or anything that communicates over the internet. So, forget about the game itself; it's all about those low-level network utilities!

#### Definition of Done (DoD)

To make sure we're on the same page and know when our P2P Tic-Tac-Toe project is complete, here's what we'll consider as "done":

- **P2P Connectivity**: The app should successfully establish a peer-to-peer connection using TCP between two players.

- **Game Logic**: The Tic-Tac-Toe game should be fully functional, allowing players to take turns and determine a winner.
